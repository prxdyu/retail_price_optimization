Welcome to my project repository for retail price optimization of food products in a burger café! This project focuses on leveraging data analytics and machine learning to determine optimal prices for food items to  maximize profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Overview

In today's competitive market, setting the right prices is crucial for business success, particularly in the food industry. Our project is divided into three main parts: data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building for price optimization.

### Parts of the Project

1. **Data Loading:**
   - We gather data from three sources using CSV files.
   - This step involves uploading and integrating data to prepare for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - We analyze the loaded data to gain insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and product performance.
   - EDA helps us understand relationships within the data and informs our pricing strategy.

3. **Model Building and Optimization:**
   - Using machine learning technique (Regression using OLS), we build models to predict customer behavior and optimize prices.
   - The goal is to find the optimal prices that maximize profitability while meeting customer demand.
